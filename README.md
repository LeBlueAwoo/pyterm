# PyTerm - an alternative CLI for Linux written entirely in Python.
PyTerm aims to make the Linux terminal just a bit more bearable by adding, amongst other things, a clock and help shortcuts that are actually useful!

I'm not one for hiding important details in reams of text so
* This is what the prompt looks like:
--------------------------------------
 [me@blah:~/home/me]-[17:42:00]     
 '>$
--------------------------------------

* The commands used are similar to those used in the 'bash' shell

* The design is based off the 'fish' shell, though just with less trippy colours! :)
